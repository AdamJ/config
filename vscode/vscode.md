# VSCode Settings

## Getting Started

- Enable Settings Sync
- Install extensions

### Extensions

By default, all of my VSCode environments have a base level of extensions installed. This allows for continuity and flow whenever I need to move between machines or operating systems. Anything specific to an environment is disabled when not needed.
